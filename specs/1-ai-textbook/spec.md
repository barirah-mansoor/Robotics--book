**Feature Branch**: `1-ai-textbook`
**Created**: 2025-12-04
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Feature: textbook-generation

Objective:
Define a complete, unambiguous specification for building the AI-native textbook with RAG chatbot.

Book Structure:
1. Introduction to Physical AI
2. Basics of Humanoid Robotics
3. ROS 2 Fundamentals
4. Digital Twin Simulation (Gazebo + Isaac)
5. Vision-Language-Action Systems
6. Capstone

Technical Requirements:
- Docusaurus
- Auto sidebar
- RAG backend (Qdrant + Neon)
- Free-tier embeddings

Optional:
- Urdu translation
- Personalize chapter

Output:
Full specification."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Learning with AI-Native Textbook (Priority: P1)

As a learner, I want to read the AI-native textbook and ask questions related to the content using the integrated RAG chatbot, so that I can quickly understand concepts and get clarifications without leaving the learning environment.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition of the feature - delivering educational content with AI assistance.

**Independent Test**: A user can navigate through the textbook chapters, select text to trigger the chatbot, ask a question, and receive an accurate, contextually relevant answer solely based on the book's content.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a learner is viewing a chapter in the textbook, **When** they select a block of text, **Then** an "Ask AI" option appears.
2. **Given** a learner has selected "Ask AI", **When** they type a question related to the selected text, **Then** the RAG chatbot provides a concise answer sourcing only from the textbook content.
3. **Given** a learner asks a question not directly answerable by the current textbook content, **When** the RAG chatbot responds, **Then** it indicates that the information is not found in the book.
4. **Given** a learner navigates through the textbook, **When** they use the auto-generated sidebar, **Then** all chapters and sections are correctly listed and navigable.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user asks a very broad question?
- How does the system handle very long text selections for the "Ask AI" feature?
- What happens if the RAG backend is temporarily unavailable?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The textbook system MUST display 6 distinct chapters covering Physical AI, Humanoid Robotics, ROS 2, Digital Twin Simulation, Vision-Language-Action Systems, and a Capstone project.
- **FR-002**: The textbook system MUST automatically generate a navigable sidebar reflecting the book's structure.
- **FR-003**: The textbook system MUST allow users to select text within a chapter to initiate a query to an AI assistant.
- **FR-004**: The AI assistant MUST provide answers to user queries based *only* on the content of the textbook.
- **FR-005**: The AI assistant MUST indicate when a query cannot be answered using the textbook's content.
- **FR-006**: (Optional) The textbook system SHOULD provide an option for Urdu translation of the content.
- **FR-007**: (Optional) The textbook system SHOULD include a customizable "Personalize" chapter.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Chapter**: A discrete section of the textbook with a title and content.
- **Learner Query**: A question posed by the user to the AI assistant.
- **AI Response**: The answer generated by the AI assistant.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: The textbook builds successfully without errors.
- **SC-002**: 95% of direct questions related to textbook content receive accurate answers from the RAG chatbot.
- **SC-003**: The user interface is clean, intuitive, and easy to navigate for 100% of tested users.
- **SC-004**: The textbook is deployed to GitHub Pages and accessible via a live URL within standard GitHub Pages deployment times.
- **SC-005**: Resource usage for the RAG chatbot and embeddings remains within free-tier limits for all expected usage patterns.
